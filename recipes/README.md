Choco-bisuit Recipe

Ingredients
250g butter, softened
350g light soft brown sugar
2 large eggs
350g self-raising flour
100g cocoa powder
200g chocolate chips or chopped chocolate chunks, or 400g for optional dipping (choose your favourite type)
Method
STEP 1
Beat the butter and sugar together with an optional pinch of sea salt in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs one at a time. Sift over the flour and cocoa powder and beat into the butter mix, then fold through the chocolate chips. The mix can be made up to 2 days ahead and chilled or frozen for a month, or used straight away.

STEP 2
To bake, heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. If the mix is at room temperature, place evenly spaced spoonfuls on parchment-lined baking sheets, allowing 2 tbsp for each cookie. If the mix is fridge cold, you can roll it into 40g balls before baking. The balls can be frozen and the biscuits baked from frozen, but they’ll need a few minutes more. Bake for 12-15 mins until spread out and crusty around the outside. Leave to cool slightly and enjoy warm, or leave to cool completely and eat cold. The biscuits will keep in a tin for three days.

STEP 3
As an optional extra, the biscuits can be dipped in chocolate. To do this, melt your chosen type of chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water or in the microwave. Leave to cool a little, then dip half of each biscuit in the chocolate and leave them on parchment-lined trays somewhere cool to set. Again, the dipped biscuits will keep for up to three days in a tin or lidded plastic container.

3-Step Biscuit Recipe

INGREDIENTS
250 grams butter or margarine

½ cup white granulated / icing sugar (depending on what you have)

2 cups cake flour

METHOD
In a bowl, cream the butter or margarine and sugar until fluffy or pale in colour, using a whisk or wooden spoon.
Sift the flour and gradually add it, when it starts to resemble crumbs, you can use your hands. Just make sure you have enough flour so that the dough doesn’t stick in your hands.
You can place the dough in the fridge for at least 20 minutes, but if the craving has really got you, you can skip this step.
Dust some flour on the working surface and rolling pin. You can use a glass to make sure that your dough is flat if you don’t have a rolling pin.
You can use a glass again to cut your biscuits into a round shape or you can cut them into any shape you desire.
Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
You can go a step further on the biscuits and melt some white chocolate. Dip the biscuits in the melted chocolate and decorate with sprinkles.
